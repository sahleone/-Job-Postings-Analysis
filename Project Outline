# Job Analysis Project Outline

## 1. Introduction
- **Objective:** To collect, preprocess, and analyze job postings data to gain insights into job market trends, skills demand, and other relevant metrics.
- **Project Status:** This project is still in progress.

## 2. Project Structure

### Scripts
- **Data Collection:** Collect job postings data from various sources and save them in a structured format for further processing.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the collected data, normalize text, and extract relevant features such as skills from job descriptions.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyze and visualize the job postings data to uncover trends, demands, and relationships. This includes:
  - Analyzing daily job postings trends
  - Distribution of job postings by location
  - Most demanded skills
  - Association analysis to find frequent itemsets and rules among skills
  - Proportion of remote vs. on-site job postings
  - Top companies posting jobs and the skills they demand
  - Creating word clouds for job descriptions and highlights
  - Performing correlation analysis between different features

## 3. Advanced Features
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implement and document machine learning models to predict job market trends or classify job postings based on skills.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Use NLP techniques to analyze job descriptions for more nuanced insights.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** 
  - Create an interactive dashboard using tools like Dash, Plotly, or Tableau to visualize key findings in an interactive and user-friendly manner.
  - Develop a simple web application to allow users to interact with the data and visualizations.
- **Data Pipeline:** Automate the data collection, preprocessing, and analysis steps using tools like Apache Airflow or Prefect.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the web application and dashboard to a platform like streamlit and include the deployment details in the documentation.

## 4. Testing and CI/CD
- **Unit Tests:** Add comprehensive unit tests for each function and script to ensure robustness.

## 5. Future Work
- **Expand Data Sources:** Incorporate additional data sources to enrich the analysis. Include industry and salary
- **Enhance Machine Learning Models:** Explore advanced machine learning models and techniques for to predict salary given a description and create a recommendation system.

## 6. Additional Notes
- **Environment Variables:** Ensure to set the necessary environment variables in the `.env` file.
- **Data Storage:** Collected and processed data is stored in specified CSV files.
- **Visualization Outputs:** Generated visualizations are saved as image files in the specified directory.
